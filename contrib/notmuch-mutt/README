notmuch-mutt: Notmuch (of a) helper for Mutt
============================================

notmuch-mutt provide integration among the [Mutt] [1] mail user agent and the
[Notmuch] [2] mail indexer.

notmuch-mutt offer two main integration features. The first one is the ability
of stating a **search query interactively** and then jump to a fresh Maildir
containing its search results only. The second one is the ability to
**reconstruct threads on the fly** starting from the currently highlighted
mail, which comes handy when a thread has been split across different maildirs,
archived, or the like.

notmuch-mutt enables to trigger mail searches via a Mutt macro (usually F8) and
reconstruct threads via another (usually F9). Check the manpage for the 2-liner
configuration snippet for your Mutt configuration files (~/.muttrc,
/etc/Muttrc, or a /etc/Muttrc.d snippet).

A [blog style introduction] [3] to notmuch-mutt is available and includes some
more rationale for its existence.

Arguably, some of the logics of notmuch-mutt could disappear by adding support
for a --output=symlinks flag to notmuch.
